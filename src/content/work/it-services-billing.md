## Executive summary

A US-based IT services company sold support and development capacity by the hour — and burned real hours every month calculating, allocating, and invoicing those hours by hand. I designed a subscription platform on Odoo where customers buy monthly hour packages that allocate themselves to projects, renew automatically on payment, and are fully visible in a self-service portal. Manual billing effort went to **zero**; client "how many hours do we have left?" queries dropped **45%**.

## The problem

- Hour packages were tracked in spreadsheets; month-end billing was a manual reconciliation exercise prone to disputes.
- Customers had no visibility into consumed hours or task progress — every question became a support email.
- Buying more hours meant a human-generated quote, slowing down exactly the moment a customer wanted to spend money.
- Onboarding and access security didn't meet the standard the company sold to its own clients.

## Key custom work

- **Self-allocating hour packages** — purchased hours flow to projects automatically as timesheets land; packages renew on successful payment with no human touch.
- **Customer portal** — clients track consumed hours and task progress in real time and buy additional hours directly from their sale orders, with instant project allocation.
- **Security hardening** — multi-step onboarding verification with automatic fraud detection, enforced strong password policy, and mandatory two-factor authentication for all users.
- **Backblaze storage layer** — all documents, attachments, and automated database backups moved to Backblaze B2, replacing the default Odoo.sh filestore for cost and control.
- **Purchase governance** — multi-level approval workflow for internal procurement.

## Challenges & decisions

**Billing logic had to be dispute-proof.** When money maps to hours, every edge case (partial hours, package boundaries, mid-month top-ups) becomes an argument waiting to happen. The allocation engine was designed so every consumed hour is traceable to a timesheet line, a project, and a package — turning billing conversations from negotiations into lookups.

**Self-service without support risk.** Letting customers buy and allocate hours themselves required the fraud-detection and verification layer up front. Security wasn't a compliance checkbox; it was the enabler of the self-service business model.

## Business impact

| Area | Before | After | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly billing effort | Manual reconciliation | Fully automated | **−100%** |
| Client status queries | Constant email traffic | Self-service portal | **−45%** |
| Hour top-up sales cycle | Quote → email → wait | In-portal, instant | Friction removed |
| Data protection | Default filestore | Backblaze + automated backups | Hardened |

## Lessons learned

- **Automation earns trust through traceability, not magic.** Clients accepted automated billing because every number could be drilled to its source.
- **The portal is a sales channel, not a cost center.** Making top-ups self-service turned support friction into revenue.
