## Executive summary

A premium car-servicing and spare-parts retail group in Saudi Arabia — 300+ employees across multiple branches and legal entities — was running its business on disconnected spreadsheets, a legacy accounting tool, and manual processes for everything from payroll to job cards. I architected and led the delivery of a single Odoo 16 platform covering HR, payroll, accounting, sales, inventory, and customer service, integrated with ZATCA Phase 2 e-invoicing, WooCommerce, and WhatsApp. The result: roughly **60% less manual work**, **1,500+ compliant e-invoices a month**, and a customer-service operation that responds **~40% faster**.

## Business context

The group operates two intertwined businesses: multi-branch vehicle servicing and a spare-parts retail operation with a growing online channel. Growth had outpaced systems — each branch kept its own records, head office consolidated numbers by hand, and Saudi Arabia's ZATCA Phase 2 e-invoicing mandate was approaching with hard deadlines and real penalties.

## The problem

- **Compliance risk:** ZATCA Phase 2 requires cryptographically signed, cleared e-invoices submitted to the Fatoora platform. The existing tools couldn't do it.
- **Payroll complexity:** Saudi labor law — GOSI contributions, overtime rules, violation management, and end-of-service benefits — was handled manually for 300+ employees, with predictable errors.
- **Fragmented operations:** sales, workshop job cards, inventory, and accounting lived in separate systems (or on paper), so management had no consolidated view across branches.
- **Slow customer service:** service requests and job-card updates flowed through phone calls, keeping response times high and staff overloaded.

## Requirements

Must-haves: ZATCA Phase 2 compliance before the mandate window; multi-company, multi-branch accounting with consolidated reporting; full Saudi payroll (GOSI, overtime, end-of-service) with an employee self-service portal; two-way WooCommerce sync for the online parts store; and a helpdesk customers would actually use — which in the Gulf means WhatsApp.

The platform runs as one Odoo database with company-level separation for each legal entity and branch-level analytic dimensions — so branch managers see their own numbers while head office gets consolidated statements without manual work.

## Key custom work

- **ZATCA Phase 2 e-invoicing** — invoice XML generation, cryptographic stamping, and clearance against the Fatoora platform, hardened for 1,500+ invoices a month with failure queues and automatic retries.
- **Saudi payroll engine** — GOSI contribution rules, overtime and violation management aligned with labor law, shift management with approval chains, and an end-of-service benefits module built to local regulations.
- **Employee self-service portal** — payslips, leave, expenses, and shift requests for 300+ employees, removing a paper bottleneck from HR.
- **WooCommerce ↔ Odoo sync** — products, stock, and 1,000+ monthly orders flowing both ways over REST, so the online store stopped being an island.
- **WhatsApp helpdesk** — a multi-channel service desk where customers open and track service requests over WhatsApp; job-card status updates go out automatically.
- **Custom appraisals** — performance workflows tied to bonus and allowance management, replacing an annual spreadsheet exercise.

## Challenges & decisions

**Clearance failures couldn't block sales.** ZATCA clearance is synchronous in spirit but the network isn't. I designed the e-invoicing flow around a queued submission model: invoices are issued immediately, signed and cleared in the background, and flagged loudly if clearance fails — protecting both cash flow and compliance.

**Payroll cutover risk.** Running 300+ employees' pay through a new system for the first time is the moment ERP projects lose trust. We ran two full parallel payroll cycles — old process and Odoo side by side — reconciling to the riyal before switching over.

**Multi-company structure.** The group's entities share suppliers and sometimes stock. Getting inter-company flows right (and keeping ZATCA reporting per-entity clean) drove the decision to model branches as analytic dimensions inside companies rather than as separate companies — less structural complexity, same reporting depth.

## Business impact

| Area | Before | After | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manual work across invoicing, payroll & job cards | Manual, spreadsheet-driven | Automated in one ERP | **−60%** |
| E-invoicing compliance | Not possible | 1,500+ cleared invoices/mo | **ZATCA Phase 2 compliant** |
| Online order handling | Re-keyed by hand | Synced automatically | **1,000+ orders/mo untouched** |
| Ticket first response | Phone-based, slow | WhatsApp-automated | **~40% faster** (client-reported) |
| Payroll for 300+ employees | Manual GOSI & EOS calculations | Rule-driven payroll engine | Errors eliminated at source |

## Lessons learned

- **Compliance deadlines are the best executive sponsor.** ZATCA's mandate created urgency that made process change stick — we sequenced the hardest workflow changes to ride that momentum.
- **In the Gulf, WhatsApp *is* the customer portal.** The web portal saw modest use; the WhatsApp channel was adopted overnight. Meeting customers where they already are beat building where we wished they were.
- **Parallel payroll runs are non-negotiable.** They cost two extra weeks and saved the project's credibility.
